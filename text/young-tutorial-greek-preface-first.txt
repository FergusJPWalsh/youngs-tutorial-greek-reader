0.0 PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.
text.1 As the Greek authors wrote for adults, their style 1s in general too elaborate and involved for continuous rending by young scholars; and the subject-matter, it must be confessed, often proves wanting in interest to readers who cannot pass casily and rapidly from point to point of the narrative. The followmg extracts are intended to familiarise the beginner with the principal constructions in simple form, before he enters upon the mastery of the more fully developed sentences of the Grreek classic authors. In making the selection the aim has been to present to the learner passages free Irom intricacy and yaried in subject; and, to aecomplish this, a good many authors have been laxt under contribution outside the ordinary circle of a sehoolboy's reading. In all cases the idiom and phraseology have been, as far as possible, adapted to Attic usage. In the Tabic of Contents the sources are indicated from which the extracts are taken. A word of explanation is necessary with regard to Part I]. of this little book. It was found so difficult to mect with a passage in Attic Greck which possessed the qualification of continuous simplicity in style combined with interest of incident, that the idea suggested itseli to the writer of putting into Greek some striking cpisode in English History. Into this version of the Battle ol Hastings he has plentifully interwoven phrases from Aenophon and Thucydides; and he is not without hope that 1t may serve as a useful introduction to the study of these authors. In connection with this Part, he thankiully acknowledges his indebtedness to several! scholars for suggestions and improvements.
